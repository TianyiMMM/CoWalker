Our project's goal is to use machine learning to identify certain gait problems of patients. We trained a model that would diagnose the patient based on his or her gait analysis in a period of 6s. It would predicts if the patient exhibit normal, antalgic, or hemigplegic gait style. The latter two would entail potential musculoskeletal or neurological disease of the patient. 

To run our program, open final_code.ipynb and run each cell. The code would load training data to fit the model, and then load testing data to test the model. In the future, we envision a foot wearable device that feeds the data to a health app in the patient's phone. The UI design is available in the file named "CoWalker_demo.xd". Two pictures of our foot wearable device prototype is submitted with our file. Unfortunately, the device is not working due to certain parts; but the main design is already built.
